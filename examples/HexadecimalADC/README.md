# ADC Noise Analysis + FFT Visualization with Serial Studio

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to read and transmit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) values from six unconnected analog pins (A0 to A5) on an Arduino and analyze the noise in the signal using **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** for frequency domain visualization in **Serial Studio**.

The Arduino reads the raw ADC values from the unconnected pins (floating values), scales them to 8-bit (0-255) binary, and transmits them over the serial port. The data is parsed and visualized in Serial Studio, where the **FFT** feature is used to observe the frequency characteristics of the noise.

### Compatibility
This project works with any Arduino board that has analog input pins. Although no external sensors are required, the analog pins **A0 to A5** will generate fluctuating noise due to their unconnected state, which can be analyzed using the FFT.

## Hardware Setup

### Connections

No external hardware is required for this project, as the analog pins (A0 to A5) are left **unconnected** to measure floating ADC values.

### Optional
If you'd like to connect external components to generate specific signals (e.g., noise, sine waves, etc.), you can connect these to the analog pins for more controlled analysis.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Arduino Sketch ([`HexadecimalADC.ino`](HexadecimalADC.ino))

This Arduino sketch reads analog values from six floating pins (A0 to A5), scales the 10-bit readings (0-1023) to 8-bit (0-255), and transmits the binary data over the serial port in frames. The data is processed by Serial Studio for FFT visualization.

- **Analog Reading**: Data is read from analog pins A0 to A5.
- **Data Conversion**: The 10-bit ADC values are mapped to 8-bit (0-255) and sent over the serial port.
- **Serial Output**: Data is framed by a start (`$`) and end (`;`) delimiter, and transmitted in binary format for visualization.

The serial output can be analyzed in **Serial Studio** using the **FFT tool** to observe the frequency spectrum of the noise or any connected signals.

The program runs at a baud rate of **115200**, ensuring smooth and high-speed data transmission.

### 2. Serial Studio Configuration

To visualize the data, Serial Studio needs to be properly configured to parse the incoming hexadecimal data:

1. **Download and Install Serial Studio**:
Visit [Serial Studio's official website](https://serial-studio.github.io/) to download and install the software.

2. **Open Serial Studio and Import `HexadecimalADC.json`**:
Launch Serial Studio and load the `HexadecimalADC.json` file included in this project using the **Project Editor**. This file contains all necessary configurations for interpreting the data transmitted by the Arduino.

#### About the JavaScript Parser Function

Since the data is transmitted in hexadecimal format, a custom JavaScript parser function is required to convert the incoming frame data into an array of decimal values that can be plotted or analyzed in Serial Studio.

Hereâ€™s the custom JavaScript parser function used by this project:

```javascript
/**
 * This function parses a binary data frame (represented as a hexadecimal string),
 * and converts it into an array of decimal values (0-255).
 *
 * @param[in]  frame  The latest received frame as a hexadecimal string.
 * @return     Array of integers containing the parsed frame elements.
 */
function parse(frame) {
    let dataArray = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < frame.length; i += 2) {
        let hexByte = frame.substring(i, i + 2);
        let decimalValue = parseInt(hexByte, 16);
        dataArray.push(decimalValue);
    }

    return dataArray;
}
```

This function reads the binary data sent from the Arduino, converts each 2-character hexadecimal byte into a decimal value (0-255), and returns an array of values that are displayed on the Serial Studio dashboard or used for FFT analysis.

You can read more about the frame parsing function [here](https://github.com/Serial-Studio/Serial-Studio/wiki/Project-Editor#frame-parser-function-view).

### 3. Analyzing Noise with FFT

Once you have configured Serial Studio and uploaded the Arduino sketch, follow these steps to analyze the noise data using FFT:

- **Connect to the Arduino**: Ensure that Serial Studio is connected to the correct serial port and that the baud rate is set to **115200**.
- **Visualize the Data**: The analog values from the unconnected ADC pins will be plotted in real time, showing random floating values due to the noise.

### Troubleshooting Tips

- **No Data in FFT Plot**: Verify that the Arduino is properly connected, and the serial port and baud rate match the configuration in Serial Studio.
- **Flat FFT Spectrum**: Unconnected ADC pins usually generate low-amplitude noise. If the FFT spectrum appears flat, try adjusting the sample rate or adding external components (such as signal generators) to visualize more pronounced frequency components.
- **Inconsistent Data**: If the data appears inconsistent, ensure that the **Hexadecimal Conversion** method in the Project Editor is selected, and the JavaScript parser is functioning correctly in Serial Studio.
